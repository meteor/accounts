## ðŸš¨ These are not the official Meteor accounts and not the correct place to report issues! ðŸš¨

The official Meteor Accounts packages are stored and officially supported via [the main Meteor repository](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/) where they can be found in their respective `accounts-<service>` folders.

If you have an issue with Meteor Accounts, you should make a reproduction and report it to [Meteor Issues](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues).

### Project Goals

This project was an attempt to decouple Meteor accounts but is not completed and still a work-in-progress (though currently stalled).  One of the goals was to decouple the view layer, which has already been done on the main Meteor repository.
